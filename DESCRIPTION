Description: This R package provides a calculation of between-cases AUC estimate, corresponding covariance, and variance estimate in the nested data problem.  Also, the package has the function to simulate the nested data. The calculated between-cases AUC estimate is used to evaluate the reader's diagnostic performance in clinical tasks with nested data. For more details on the above methods, please refer to the paper by H Du, S Wen, Y Guo, F Jin, BD Gallas (2022) <doi:10.1177/09622802221111539>.
